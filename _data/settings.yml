blurb:  <strong>My name is Matthew Ryan Evans</strong>, and I am a freelance front-end
            developer working and supporting the community of St. Louis, Missouri. I started
            developing websites in 2008 and continued to as a hobby though my post-secondary
            education. After some soul searching in the land of the rising sun I returned to university to
            follow my passion for technology and software development. I am currently studying
            Software Development at Western Governors University and plan to graduate in 2019. The
            thing that excites me most about technology is that we are no longer bound by hardware
            limitations, but merely by the depth of our own imagination, and that’s what drives me
            every day, to learn and develop, to make dreams realties.

                                        <p><strong>What is CPR-N-MORE.com?</strong></p>
                                        <p>CPR-N-MORE was the first company I ever developed a website for
                                        and was the place I cut my teeth as it where in the development space. The
                                        site was originally developed using WordPress but has gone on to be
                                        refined utilizing conventional HTML5 and custom CSS styling. APIs
                                        where also incorporated to help facilitate the online ecommerce aspect of
                                        the site as well as maintain the even handling features of the site.</p>

                                        <p>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, WordPress and APIs
                                        (PayPal, Event Expresso)</p>
                                        <p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>
                                        <p>CPR-N-MORE is a St. Louis based CPR and AED training company.
                                        I was one of the first independent contractors hired by the company and
                                        tasked with creating maintain their online presence. The site was much
                                        more than landing page for the company as it was the primary resource for
                                        potential students to register for upcoming class. In the early days I
                                        managed the registration process utilizing a mixture of individual HTML
                                        pages for corresponding class dates and then linking them to a calendar,
                                        so customers could navigate to the class of their choosing. Today it is a
                                        much different story, as we have integrated Event Expressos API allowing
                                        us to maintain and customers multiple facets of the registration process
                                        and collet all pertinent data in a safe and secure way. Another major aspect
                                        of the website when it was first incepted was the ecommerce section of the
                                        site where the company sold AEDs and other various first aid and safety
                                        related merchandise. This aspect of the site was accomplished by
                                        integrating the PayPal API directly into the site and structuring a page on
                                        the website to act as a virtual catalog for potential customers to brows the
                                        company’s goods. I learned an extensive amount during my time
                                        developing this site and look back on the experience as I move forward as
                                        a developer.</p>
                                        <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p>
                                        <p>I learned that you never stop learning, every day I worked on
                                        CPR-N-MORE’s website I continued to learn something new.
                                        Additionally, I learned that value of strong problem-solving skills as any
                                        adversity can be overcome with the right fortitude.</p>

                            administrative department to help expedite the process of sifting through

                                        <p><strong>What is OnMax?</strong></p>
                                        <p>OnMax is a macro enabled workbook developed for Enterprise in
                                        response to the overwhelming amount of data that the administrative
                                        department had to sift through to onboard each new hire class.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Technologies Utilized:</strong></p>
                                        <p>VBA and Excel</p>
                                        <p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>
                                        <p>OnMax was developed for Enterprise Rent-A-Car, specifically their
                                        administrative department to help expedite the process of sifting through
                                        employee information and the creation of the relevant documentation to
                                        facilitate the process of onboarding process new employees. The problem
                                        that existed and the catalyst for the inception of OnMax was the daunting
                                        amount of information that the department had to sift through for each
                                        new hire class. The average class would be around 30 individuals and
                                        each of them would have at least 30 different points of data that would be
                                        attached to them, and only a few of each of these data points would be
                                        relevant to any individual department so the task of creating spreadsheets
                                        was an immense one that took many hours of tedious work, and this could
                                        happen anywhere from once a week to multiple times a week, and a
                                        solution had to be found to resolve this hurdle.</p>
                                        <p>I sat down with the head of System administrations and was advised
                                        of the problem at hand and was asked to develop a solution but was told
                                        my limitations where that it would need to be deployable on an imaged
                                        virtual desktop with no administrative access. Undeterred I set to work
                                        brainstorming possible solutions, and finally settled on a macro enabled
                                        workbook within excel. It was an elegant solution as it could be small
                                        enough to be implemented and moved from virtual machine to virtual
                                        machine, but robust and powerful as its backbone was built on VBA.</p>
                                        <p>The exported “master” data came from Microsoft Access and pasted
                                        seamlessly into an excel spreadsheet. After the master data had been
                                        imported into the spreadsheet the macro I wrote took the data and
                                        partitioned it into multiple different camps so that it could be then
                                        reinjected back into a separate workbook as a single excel document that
                                        had the proper information for any given department. As there was no way
                                        to know which documentation would be needed on any given basis I
                                        developed multiple different export buttons which depending on the
                                        desired information would extract the appropriate corresponding data
                                        point and inject it into a separate spreadsheet.</p>
                                        <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p>
                                        <p>I learned that simplicity is not always a bad thing, sometimes the most
                                        elegant solutions are the simple ones. Over engineering a solution can be
                                        fun, but when a problem needs to be addressed. It is better to fall back on
                                        what you know and deliver a solution and then refine form there.</p>
