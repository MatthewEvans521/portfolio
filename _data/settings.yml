blurb:  <strong>My name is Matthew Ryan Evans.</strong> I tend to describe myself as
            <i>wide-eyed, enthusiastic, and driven...</i> above all else I am
            <strong>passionate</strong> about technology. It inspires me and is my catalyst to
            continue to learn, explore and push the boundaries of what we currently believe is possible.
            I started programing as a hobby while I was in high school and choose to continue my
            education at Western Governors University to study Software Development and plan to
            graduate in 2019. Alongside a full time job, and course load I still find time to freelance
            building websites for local small buisnesses.

                                        <p><strong>What is CPR-N-MORE.com?</strong></p>
                                        <p>CPR-N-MORE was the first company I ever developed a website for
                                        and was the place I cut my teeth as it where as a web developer. The site
                                        was originally developed using WordPress but as both it and my
                                        knowledge grew it was refined and prospered into the site it is today.
                                        Utilizing conventional HTML5 and custom CSS styling as well as the
                                        incorporation of APIs I was able to obtain the vison and requirements put
                                        forth by the company’s owners. It went on to become the pivotal tool in
                                        company’s arsenal, facilitating not only sales but as the main registration
                                        hub for potential students/customers.</p>

                                        <p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>
                                        <p>CPR-N-MORE is a St. Louis based CPR and AED sales and training
                                        company. I was one of the first independent contractors hired by the
                                        company and tasked with creating and maintain their online presence. The
                                        site was much more than landing page for the company as it was the
                                        primary resource for potential students to register for upcoming class. In
                                        the early days I managed the registration process utilizing a mixture of
                                        individual HTML pages for corresponding class and then linking them to
                                        a calendar, so customers could navigate to the class of their choosing with
                                        ease. Today it is a much different story, as we have integrated Event
                                        Expressos’ API allowing us to maintain and customize multiple facets of
                                        the registration process and collet all pertinent data in a safe and secure
                                        way. Another major aspect of the website when it was first incepted was
                                        the ecommerce section of the site where the company sold AEDs and
                                        other various first aid and safety related merchandise. This aspect of the
                                        site was accomplished by integrating the PayPal API directly into the site
                                        and structuring a page to act as a virtual catalog for potential customers to
                                        brows the company’s goods. I learned an extensive amount during my
                                        time developing this site and look back on the experience as I move
                                        forward as a developer.</p>
                                        <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p>
                                        <p>I learned that you never stop learning, every day I worked on website
                                        I continued to learn something new. Additionally, I learned that value of
                                        strong problem-solving skills as any adversity can be overcome with the
                                        right mindset.</p>

#---------------------------------------------------- Project 2 ----------------------------------------------------#
project-2Title: OnMax
project-2Blurb: <p>OnMax was developed for Enterprise Rent-A-Car, specifically their
                            administrative department to help expedite the process of sifting through
                            employee information and the creation of the relevant documentation to facilitate
                            the process of onboarding process new employees…. <br><u>More</u></p>

                                        <p><strong>What is OnMax?</strong></p>
                                        <p>OnMax is a macro enabled workbook developed for Enterprise in
                                        response to the overwhelming amount of data that the administrative staff
                                        had to sift through to onboard each new hire class. The macro automated
                                        the process and turned a drawn-out tedious task into just a few clicks of
                                        the mouse..</p>

                                        <p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>
                                        <p>OnMax was macro enabled workbook developed for Enterprise
                                        Rent-A-Car, specifically for their administrative staff to help expedite the
                                        process of sifting through employee information and the creation of the
                                        relevant documentation to request anything form security codes to email
                                        access. The original process had the administrative staff sifting through a
                                        document with thirty+ different data points per employee and extracting
                                        only a hand full of them to create the required documents for each relevant
                                        department. This was a sub optimal and arduous task that could take
                                        multiple hours depending on the size of the income class of new hires.
                                        Therefore, I was tasked to find a solution, but found that the limiting
                                        factors of an all virtual environment without administrative access a
                                        hostile workplace for creativity. I was forced to think materialistically, but
                                        critically, the solution had to be small and piggyback off an already
                                        existing structure that the end user had access to on their virtual machine.
                                        After great deliberation I decided that the most practical solution would be
                                        to utilize a macro enabled work book in excel and write a custom VBA
                                        script to parse and array that data to be called into an independent excel
                                        sheet depending on the needs of the end user. VBA functions second
                                        nature within excel, and as it has similarity between both C and .NET it
                                        proved to be both versatile and comprehensive. As this application is still
                                        in use today, I believe the solution I provided did indeed meet expectations
                                        and a second revision with the ability for the end-user to input custom data
                                        on the fly is currently in the works.</p>
                                        <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p>
                                        <p>I learned that simplicity is not always a bad thing, sometimes the most
                                        elegant solutions are the simple ones. Additionally, limitations are not
                                        always a hurdle to overcome, but merely a biproduct of the environment at
                                        hand. Lastly, it’s better to fall back on what you know and deliver a
                                        solution that works, and then refine form there.</p>
