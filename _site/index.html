        <p><strong>My name is Matthew Ryan Evans</strong>, and I am a freelance front-end developer working and supporting the community of St. Louis, Missouri. I started developing websites in 2008 and continued to as a hobby though my post-secondary education. After some soul searching in the land of the rising sun I returned to university to follow my passion for technology and software development. I am currently studying Software Development at Western Governors University and plan to graduate in 2019. The thing that excites me most about technology is that we are no longer bound by hardware limitations, but merely by the depth of our own imagination, and that’s what drives me every day, to learn and develop, to make dreams realties.</p>

                <h4>CPR-N-MORE.COM</h4>
                <img src="/portfolio/assets/img/projects/cprnmore/img-2.png" alt=""> <p><strong>What is CPR-N-MORE.com?</strong></p> <p>CPR-N-MORE was the first company I ever developed a website for and was the place I cut my teeth as it where in the development space. The site was originally developed using WordPress but has gone on to be refined utilizing conventional HTML5 and custom CSS styling. APIs where also incorporated to help facilitate the online ecommerce aspect of the site as well as maintain the even handling features of the site.</p> <p><strong>Technologies Utilized:</strong></p> <p>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, WordPress and APIs (PayPal, Event Expresso)</p> <p><strong>The Story:</strong></p> <p>CPR-N-MORE is a St. Louis based CPR and AED training company. I was one of the first independent contractors hired by the company and tasked with creating maintain their online presence. The site was much more than landing page for the company as it was the primary resource for potential students to register for upcoming class. In the early days I managed the registration process utilizing a mixture of individual HTML pages for corresponding class dates and then linking them to a calendar, so customers could navigate to the class of their choosing. Today it is a much different story, as we have integrated Event Expressos API allowing us to maintain and customers multiple facets of the registration process and collet all pertinent data in a safe and secure way. Another major aspect of the website when it was first incepted was the ecommerce section of the site where the company sold AEDs and other various first aid and safety related merchandise. This aspect of the site was accomplished by integrating the PayPal API directly into the site and structuring a page on the website to act as a virtual catalog for potential customers to brows the company’s goods. I learned an extensive amount during my time developing this site and look back on the experience as I move forward as a developer.</p> <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p> <p>I learned that you never stop learning, every day I worked on CPR-N-MORE’s website I continued to learn something new. Additionally, I learned that value of strong problem-solving skills as any adversity can be overcome with the right fortitude.</p> <a href="#projects">top</a>

                <h4>OnMax</h4>
                <img src="/portfolio/assets/img/projects/onmax/onmaxThumbnail.png" alt=""> <p><strong>What is OnMax?</strong></p> <p>OnMax is a macro enabled workbook developed for Enterprise in response to the overwhelming amount of data that the administrative department had to sift through to onboard each new hire class.</p> <p><strong>Technologies Utilized:</strong></p> <p>VBA and Excel</p> <p><strong>The Story:</strong></p> <p>OnMax was developed for Enterprise Rent-A-Car, specifically their administrative department to help expedite the process of sifting through employee information and the creation of the relevant documentation to facilitate the process of onboarding process new employees. The problem that existed and the catalyst for the inception of OnMax was the daunting amount of information that the department had to sift through for each new hire class. The average class would be around 30 individuals and each of them would have at least 30 different points of data that would be attached to them, and only a few of each of these data points would be relevant to any individual department so the task of creating spreadsheets was an immense one that took many hours of tedious work, and this could happen anywhere from once a week to multiple times a week, and a solution had to be found to resolve this hurdle.</p> <p>I sat down with the head of System administrations and was advised of the problem at hand and was asked to develop a solution but was told my limitations where that it would need to be deployable on an imaged virtual desktop with no administrative access. Undeterred I set to work brainstorming possible solutions, and finally settled on a macro enabled workbook within excel. It was an elegant solution as it could be small enough to be implemented and moved from virtual machine to virtual machine, but robust and powerful as its backbone was built on VBA.</p> <p>The exported “master” data came from Microsoft Access and pasted seamlessly into an excel spreadsheet. After the master data had been imported into the spreadsheet the macro I wrote took the data and partitioned it into multiple different camps so that it could be then reinjected back into a separate workbook as a single excel document that had the proper information for any given department. As there was no way to know which documentation would be needed on any given basis I developed multiple different export buttons which depending on the desired information would extract the appropriate corresponding data point and inject it into a separate spreadsheet.</p> <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p> <p>I learned that simplicity is not always a bad thing, sometimes the most elegant solutions are the simple ones. Over engineering a solution can be fun, but when a problem needs to be addressed. It is better to fall back on what you know and deliver a solution and then refine form there.</p> <a href="#projects">top</a>
