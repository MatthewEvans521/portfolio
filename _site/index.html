        <p><strong>My name is Matthew Ryan Evans.</strong> I tend to describe myself as <i>wide-eyed, enthusiastic, and driven...above all else I am passionate about technology. It inspires me and it is my catalyst to continue to learn, explore and push the boundaries of what we currently believe is possible.I began programming as a hobby in high school. Although I initially pursued my interest of film-making in college and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Film, ultimately I realize that my true interest and career ambition was in Computer Science. I am currently enrolled at Western Governors University, studying Software Development with plans to graduate in 2019. In addition to a full-time job and course load, I still find time to freelance and assist small businesses with website development.</p>

                <h4>CPR-N-MORE.COM</h4>
                <img src="/portfolio/assets/img/projects/cprnmore/img-2.png" alt=""> <p><strong>What is CPR-N-MORE.com?</strong></p> <p>CPR-N-MORE was my first Website Development job and the place I cut my teeth in web design and site development utilizing WordPress but as both it and my knowledge grew it was refined and morphed into the site it is today. Utilizing conventional HTML5 and custom CSS styling as well as the incorporation of APIs, I was able to create a product that incorporated both the owner's vision and requirements and in so doing, became the pivotal tool in the company's arsenal to reach CPR and First Aid clients throughout Missouri and Eastern Illinois, reportedly boosting sales and service by more than 70% through the creation of an online store for the purchase of AEDs and safety equipment and more importantly, created the platform for an interactive registration and payment hub for individual student registrations and large businesses alike.</p> <p><strong>Technologies Utilized:</strong></p> <p>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, WordPress and APIs (PayPal, Event Expresso)</p> <p><strong>The Story:</strong></p> <p>CPR-N-MORE is a St. Louis based CPR and AED sales and training company. I was one of the first independent contractors hired by the company and tasked with creating and maintain their online presence. The site was much more than a landing page for the company as it was the primary resource for potential students to register for upcoming course offerings. In the early days I managed the registration process utilizing a mixture of individual HTML pages for corresponding class and then linking them to a calendar, so customers could navigate to the class of their choosing with ease. Today it is a much different story, as we have integrated Event Espresso's API allowing us to maintain and customize multiple facets of the registration process and collect all pertinent data in a safe and secure way. Another major aspect of the website at its inception, was the e-commerce section of the site where the company sold AEDs and other various first aid and safety related merchandise. This aspect of the site was accomplished by integrating the PayPal API directly into the site and structuring the page to act as a virtual catalog for potential customers to browse the company’s online store. I learned an extensive amount during my time developing this site and look back on the experience as I move forward as a developer.</p> <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p> <p>I learned that you never stop learning  and each day that I worked on the website, I continued to learn something new. Additionally, I learned that value of strong problem-solving while addressing the many unknowns while creating the site.</p> <a href="#projects">top</a>

                    <h4>OnMax</h4>
                    <img src="/portfolio/assets/img/projects/onmax/onmaxThumbnail.png" alt=""> <p><strong>What is OnMax?</strong></p> <p>OnMax is a macro enabled workbook developed for Enterprise in response to the overwhelming amount of data that the administrative staff has to sift through to onboard each new hire class. The macro automated the process and turned a drawn-out tedious task into just a few clicks of the mouse..</p> <p><strong>Technologies Utilized:</strong></p> <p>VBA and Excel</p> <p><strong>The Story:</strong></p> <p>OnMax was macro enabled workbook developed for Enterprise Rent-A-Car, specifically for their administrative staff to help expedite the process of sifting through employee information and the creation of the relevant documentation to request anything form security codes to email access. The original process had the administrative staff sifting through a document with thirty+ different data points per employee and extracting only a hand full of them to create the required documents for each relevant department. This was a sub optimal and arduous task that could take multiple hours depending on the size of the income class of new hires. Therefore, I was tasked to find a solution, but found that the limiting factors of an all virtual environment without administrative access a hostile workplace for creativity. I was forced to think materialistically, but critically, the solution had to be small and piggyback off an already existing structure that the end user had access to on their virtual machine. After great deliberation I decided that the most practical solution would be to utilize a macro enabled work book in excel and write a custom VBA script to parse and array that data to be called into an independent excel sheet depending on the needs of the end user. VBA functions second nature within excel, and as it has similarity between both C and .NET it proved to be both versatile and comprehensive. As this application is still in use today, I believe the solution I provided did indeed meet expectations and a second revision with the ability for the end-user to input custom data on the fly is currently in the works.</p> <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p> <p>I learned that simplicity is not always a bad thing, sometimes the most elegant solutions are the simple ones. Additionally, limitations are not always a hurdle to overcome, but merely a byproduct of the environment at hand. Lastly, it’s better to fall back on what you know and deliver a solution that works, and then refine form there.</p> <a href="#projects">top</a>
