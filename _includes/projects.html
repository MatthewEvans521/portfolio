                <p>CPR-N-MORE is a St. Louis based CPR and AED training company. Founded in 2006
                I was one of the first independent contractors hired by the company tasked with creating
                mainting there online presence. The site is not just a landing page for there company, but also
                acts at the hub for the companys event planning and class roster system. Durring the early days
                of CPR-N-MORE the site also had an ecomerce component to it where they sold AED uints, this
                has since been removed form the website as of 2017 I no longer manage the CPR-N-MORE website. </p>
